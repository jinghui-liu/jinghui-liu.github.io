<h2>{{'Apr 27, 2021'}}</h2>

<small>Sat through 2.5 hrs of student talks from class (muon lifetime, well...), ouch. Today is the first time our instructor quoted lots of my questions in his discussion time (after student talks TA ask questions first, then the PI, we were never in the same channel before). Probably it's nothing but still I find it weirdly satisfying :).</small>

<br><br>

<small>I thought a per-six-month lab inspection was today (I'm held responsible for such duty), but it turns out next Monday, I should get more sleep :/.</small>

<br><br>

<small>Made a heart-breaking move in the evening, then worked on website straight for hours to feel minimally better. Would it be better if we had not fallen, sad chuckles.</small>
