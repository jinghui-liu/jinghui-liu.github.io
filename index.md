<body> 

For a physicist, the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2104191118#sm01">growth</a> and <a href="https://movie.rupress.org/video/10.1083/jcb.201203154/video-1">regeneration</a> of living organisms are marvelous organizations of signaling and building blocks to adore. The seek of generalizable physical principles in this context can be a natural but intimidating quest, given the complexity in developmental biology and so on. Yet, grand opportunities lie in such a junction for interdisciplinary biophysicists, that a combo of emerging experimental tools and developing nonequilibrium theories can bring condensed matter physics and cell biology minds together.

I joined the Center for Systems Biology Dresden as an <a href="https://www.csbdresden.de/join-us/as-a-postdoc/">ELBE postdoc fellow</a> in Oct 2022, working between the Max Planck Institute for Physics of Complex Systems and the Max Planck Institute for Cell Biology and Genetics. I received my PhD in <a href="https://physics.mit.edu">Physics from MIT</a> in Sep 2022 and hold a Bachelor of Science degree, also in <a href="https://english.phy.pku.edu.cn">Physics, from Peking University</a> (2016).

<!-- I worked on the protein patterning process in dividing starfish eggs and more recently wound healing response in zebrafish. My research interest lies in understanding the organization principles of information-transmitting biological processes. -->

<!-- Combining tools of experiments, theory-driven analyses and numerical simulations, I took the sea star (<i>P. Miniata</i>) egg cell as a model system and studied <a href="\proj-turbulence.html">the organization principle of a developmental signaling process from a topological point of view</a>. Motivated by the information-processing nature of the biological process, we also explored and established <a href="\proj-braiding.html">the close correspondence between information loss and the topologically-significant braiding dynamics</a>. On the tool development perspective, I have designed and implemented <a href="\proj-optogenetics.html">an optogenetics system in the sea star egg cell to harness controllability in the mechanochemical machinery</a>. In the future I plan to continue pursuit on this line of research interest, <a href="\research-page.html#future">potentially in more sophisciated biological and physical settings.</a> -->

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
