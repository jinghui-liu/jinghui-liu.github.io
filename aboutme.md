<!-- ## Academics
Jinghui Liu is currently a graduate student in <a href="https://web.mit.edu/physics/">Department of Physics, MIT</a>. She started in the department in 2016, after completing her undergraduate training at <a href="http://english.pku.edu.cn">Peking University</a> with a Bachelor's degree of Science in Physics.

She joined in <a href="https://www.fakhrilab.com">Fakhri Lab</a> located in <a href="https://cpls.scripts.mit.edu/wordpress/">Physics of Living Systems Center</a> since 2017, and has been working on the series of intriguing projects at the crossing of living systems and non-equilibrium physics since. In her undergrad she had a research background working on the nonlinear dynamical properties of cancerous signaling networks in <a href="http://www.aais.pku.edu.cn/en/cqb/showproduct.php?id=230">Ouyang Lab</a> and microbial populations in <a href="http://www.gorelab.org/">Gore Lab</a>.

Check out her published and ongoing works at [Publications](./pub-page.html), <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UaZr6oIAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a>, and <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2770-8415">ORCID</a>.

## Awards
Jinghui is the recipient of the 2016-2017 Morton E. Goulder Presidential fellowship in MIT. She is a finalist for <a href="https://www.aps.org/units/gsnp/awards/student-speaker.cfm"> GSNP Student Speaker Award </a> at APS 2020 (virtual). More recently, she has been chosen to speak at the <a href="https://mrsec.uchicago.edu/education/for-our-research-community/rising-stars-in-soft-and-biological-matter/">Rising Stars in Soft and Biological Matter Symposium</a>, held by UChicago. 

Jinghui has participated in a number of academic conferences in the role of invited student speaker. E.g. Check out the following two websites for recorded versions of her talks:

<p style="textalign:center;">
<b>2019 Dec, Flatiron Institute <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/event/universality-turbulence-across-vast-scales-598/">"Universality: Turbulence Across Vast Scales"</a></b>
</p>
<p style="textalign:center;">
<b>2019 May, Boston University <a href="http://physics.bu.edu/theory-living-systems/meetings/2019.html">"Theory of living systems Meeting"</a></b>
</p>

## Activities
Jinghui has been an active officier of her <a href="http://eh.mit.edu/index.php/officers/">MIT graduate dorm's committee</a> in 2016-2018. She is currently working as a student member for MIT's departmental <a href="https://physrefs.mit.edu/about-us">Resources of Easing Friction and Stress</a> group.  -->
