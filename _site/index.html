From a physicist's standpoint, living systems are marvelous constitutions of molecular building blocks that organize and function naturally across vast spatial and temporal scales. By nature, these blocks embed energy-dissipating machineries that drive the organisms far from equilibrium, evading the decay to quiescent death (quoting <a href="http://www.whatislife.ie/downloads/What-is-Life.pdf">Schr<span>&#246;</span>dinger</a>) but also evading our convenient theoretical regime of statistical mechanics. The seek of physical principles governing the organization and functioning of living processes therefore presents both rich test grounds for non-equilibrium theories and noval oppurtunities for capturing the inherent compleity of living organisms.
<br /><br />

On the other hand, modern scientific advances have brought to our sight an unprecedented amount of exciting tools for quantitatively perturbing and alternating components of living systems and even with a spatiotemporal precision. The potential of combining a physics mindset and a biology toolset together to understand and even control complex dynamics in living systems has been my inspiration. Quoting <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/177/4047/393.full.pdf">P.W. Anderson</a>, "At each level of complexity entirely new properties appear, and the understanding of the new behaviors requires research which I think I as fundamental in its nature as any other..."
<br /><br />

I am currently a PhD student in Fakhri Lab at MIT, expecting graduation in 2022 summer. Combining tools of experiments, theory-driven analyses and numerical simulations, I took the sea star (<i>P. Miniata</i>) egg cell as a model system and studied <a href="\proj-turbulence.html">the organization principle of a developmental signaling process from a topological point of view</a>. Motivated by the information-processing nature of the biological process, we also explored and established <a href="\proj-braiding.html">the close correspondence between information loss and the topologically-significant braiding dynamics</a>. On the tool development perspective, I have designed and implemented <a href="\proj-optogenetics.html">an optogenetics system in the sea star egg cell to harness controllability in the mechanochemical machinery</a>. In the future I plan to continue pursuit on this line of research interest, <a href="\research-page.html">potentially in more sophisciated biological and physical settings</a>.
