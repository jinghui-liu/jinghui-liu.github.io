<h2>Apr 29, 2021</h2>

<small>Melis defended! Now I am officially the senior-est PhD in lab, splitting my authority with Junang &#128558;</small>

<br><br>

<small>Talked to a G1 student in the middle of his shopping-for-rotations. There is a fair chance he choose to *help* on my project I sensed, we'll see next week...        (Mixed feelings on giving trainings but perhaps I should try be proud, if my pitch ends taken up from the shopping list &#9989;)</small>

<br><br>

<small>&#127808; Took extra power naps after the two late nights~ hope someone has got a pleasant workday now blessed with the powerful immunity :))</small>

<br><br>


<h2>Apr 28, 2021</h2>

<small>Sat through 2.5 hrs of student talks from class (muon lifetime, well...), ouch. Today is the first time our instructor quoted lots of my questions in his discussion time (after student talks TA ask questions first, then the PI, we were never in the same channel before). Probably it's nothing but still I find it weirdly satisfying :).</small>

<br><br>

<small>I thought a per-six-month lab inspection was today (I'm held responsible for such duty), but it turns out next Monday, I should get more sleep :/.</small>

<br><br>

<small>Made a heart-breaking move in the evening, then worked on website straight for hours to feel minimally better. Would it be better if we had not fallen, sad chuckles.</small>
